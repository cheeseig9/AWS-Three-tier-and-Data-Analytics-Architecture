The AWS architecture of a three-tier system involves separating the frontend, backend, and database layers. The frontend layer consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hosted on Amazon S3, while the backend layer runs on Amazon EC2 instances with Apache Web Server and a Java application. The database layer utilizes Amazon RDS with MySQL for data storage and retrieval. In Amazon RDS also created read replicas in second AZ to make sure read scalability and can improve overall performance. This architecture provides scalability, modularity, and security for hosting dynamic websites.

For analytics workloads, AWS provides a robust architecture. Data can be stored on-premises or in Amazon S3, and the analytics workload can be managed using Amazon EMR. EMR leverages Apache Hadoop for distributed processing, enabling large-scale data analysis. Visualization tools such as Amazon QuickSight or third-party solutions can be integrated to derive insights from the processed data.

To combine on-premises and AWS architecture, you can use AWS Direct Connect or a VPN connection to establish a secure and private connection between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS. This enables data transfer between your on-premises data sources and the AWS services. For example, you can use AWS Database Migration Service to migrate on-premises databases to Amazon RDS, making the data accessible for analytics on EMR. It offers real-time data replication and continuous data validation, allowing us to keep our on-premises database synchronized with the migrated database.
For the frontend migration, we chose to use Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront to host and distribute our static web content. Amazon S3 provides highly durable object storage with built-in scalability, ensuring our website's availability and accommodating future growth. Leveraging Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) improves content delivery speed by caching content at edge locations closer to end users, resulting in reduced latency.

By combining on-premises and AWS architectures, you can leverage the scalability, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility of the cloud for your analytics workloads, while seamlessly integrating with your existing on-premises infrastructure.
